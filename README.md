## Project Overview
This project was built as a part of my learning journey in backend development and APIs. It covers:
- Working with Python libraries like Flask for API creation
- Grayscale image conversion using Pillow
- Learning project structuring and virtual environments
- Future integration with Docker for deployment
  
---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Flask (for API)
  - Pillow (for image processing)
- **Environment Management:** Virtual environment (`venv`)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Deployment (planned):** Docker

## Setup Instructions
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/Anisha2407/grayscale-image-converter.git`<br/>
`cd grayscale-image-converter`
### Create and Activate Virtual Environment
For Windows<br/>
`python -m venv venv`<br/>
`venv\Scripts\activate`<br/>
### Install Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Run the application
`python app.py`<br/>
- Open the postman app, set it up, upload the picture and click send.

## Future Enhancements
 - Add RESTful API endpoint using Flask
 - Dockerize the application for easy deployment
 - Build a frontend interface for user interaction
